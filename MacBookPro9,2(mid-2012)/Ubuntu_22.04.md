# Ubuntu 22.04 on the MacBookPro 9,2 (Mid-2012 unibody, non-retina)
*last updated Mar 12 2024*

This MacBookPro is one of the most common legacy (pre-retina) devices. Even when the retina MacBooks were introduced in 2012 Apple kept the 13-inch MacBookPro around for many years. Maybe because it was the last MacBook with an optical disk drive. So these chique unibody devices can be picked up cheaply on Ebay for example.

✅ **And running Ubuntu on them is actually super easy!**

## Installation

As of Ubuntu 22.04.4 all you need to do is create your install USB drive, stick it into the MacBook, hold down the `Alt` key and select `EFI Boot`. Then install normally.

⚠️ You will not have wifi in the live environment and during the installer, so you need to plug the MacBook into a wired ethernet connection. Then enable `Install 3rd party drivers and software` in the installer and after a reboot wifi will work flawlessly.

❤️ That's literally it.
