# Running Ubuntu on legacy Macs

This is my collection of docs on how to run modern Ubuntu on old Intel Macs. ðŸ™‚

## MacBook7,1 (mid-2010, polycarbonate)
The [Mid-2010 white polycarbonate MacBook](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.4-white-13-polycarbonate-unibody-mid-2010-specs.html) is an iconic device. Sure, with its Core 2 Duo P8600 it's not going to break any speed records, but if you adjust expectations accordingly it's still a competent machine for webbrowsing and media comsumption. Installing an SSD and doing a RAM upgrade (it can go up to 16GB - double that of the Pro models from the era!) helps of course. I currently don't recommend running Ubuntu 24.04 on this MacBook, but Ubuntu 22.04 works like a charm, is easy to set up and still has a lot of life (and support) in it.
* [Ubuntu 22.04 Guide](/MacBook7%2C1(mid-2010)/Ubuntu_22.04.md) **recommended**

## MacBookPro9,2 (mid-2012, unibody)
This MacBookPro is one of the most common legacy (pre-retina) devices. Even when the retina MacBooks were introduced in 2012 Apple kept the 13-inch MacBookPro around for many years. Maybe because it was the last MacBook with an optical disk drive. So these chique unibody devices can be picked up cheaply on Ebay for example.
